Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have characters <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engraving> 
engraved</a> or <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing> printed </a> on them, and each press of a key 
typically corresponds to a single written <a href=shorturl.at/esu69> symbol.</a> However, producing 
some symbols may require pressing and for holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence.

<!--The advantage of everyone writing similar semantic HTML is when it comes to having to trace errors 
changing a line of code. it makes it easier to locate specific things-->

<!--could cause for longer lines of code and causing web pages to talk longer to develop-->
